# Beer Tap Dispenser 

API documentation: https://rviewer.stoplight.io/docs/beer-tap-dispenser/juus8uwnzzal5-beer-tap-dispenser

## Brief description 

Typescript app with testing in Jest (unit testing and integration testing with superagent). 

Patterns:
* Repository (to easily change persistence)
* Strategy to easily switch the way costs are computed and to make the testing process easier 

Try to use Interfaces and DTO to decouple layers.
